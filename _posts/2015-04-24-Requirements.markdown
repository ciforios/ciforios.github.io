As of now you need a Macintosh in order to compile your source code. This could for example be a Macbook or what we used a Mac mini. Compiling source code is essential for [**automated building**](http://ciforios.github.io/jenkins/) including [**automated testing**](http://ciforios.github.io/jenkins/), as well as  for [**deploying your beta software**](http://ciforios.github.io/workflow/) via testflight. If you are only interested in implementing a [**code-review**](http://ciforios.github.io/gerrit/) process into your development workflow a Macintosh is not essential.
