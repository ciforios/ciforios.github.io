###Setup
- Download war file from http://jenkins-ci.org/ -> version 1.620
- Create Jenkins folder in Application und move war file there
<br />Hint: *Jenkins requires Java7 or later*. 
<br />Download from https://www.java.com/de/download/mac_download.jsp*
<br />1. Install Java from pkg. Oracle's installer puts java inside the /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin. And it doesn't overwrite /usr/bin/java
<br />2. Check java version in terminal -> java -version 
<br />3. It won't be set to latest java version. Do following:
  * ```sudo rm /usr/bin/java``` -> Remove old symbol link (points to /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/A/Commands/java, which is Apple's 1.6 version)
  * ```sudo ln -s /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/Home/bin/java /usr/bin``` -> Replace /usr/bin/java symlink
- Start Jenkins via: ```java -jar /Applications/Jenkins/jenkins.war &```
  * Open Jenkins via Webfrontend: [http://localhost:8080/]
[http://localhost:8080/]: http://localhost:8080/
