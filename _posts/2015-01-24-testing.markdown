##Preparing your system
Before you can start to setup a Jenkins job for automated testing you need to make sure that you've installed all dependencies.

### 1. install ocunit2junit
Jenkins is able to show JUnit test-reports in the Jenkins webinterface. To use this functionality with an Xcode-project you need to convert the test-reports of the *xcodebuild* in a JUnit-XML format. Therefor we used a script called *OCUnit2JUnit*.

Install the script by entering the following command in your terminal: 

	gem install ocunit2junit
>make sure you have [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org) installed

	
### 2. run iPhone Simulator
You need to start the *iPhone Simulator* on your Jenkins user manually and let it run in background. 

>Otherwise tests will fail with the following error message:
>*iPhoneSimulator: Could not launch simulator: -10810*

Open the iOS Simulator by following these steps:

1. login to your jenkins user on your build server
2. search *iOS Simulator* via spotlight
3. open it and let it run in background forever

>In order to start the iPhone Simulator we the used the screen sharing tool **Screen Sharing** which is delivered with OSX.

###Build step - xcodebuild
To trigger automated tests after a successful build, you need to add another build step in your previously created job. 

1. click on *Add build step*
2. select *Execute shell*
3. paste the following shell command in the *Command field* (don't forget to edit the project and scheme name)

```bash	
xcodebuild -project YourPorjectName.xcodeproj -sdk iphonesimulator -scheme YourSchemeName clean test 2>&1 | ocunit2junit
```

###Post build action - Publish JUnit test report result
Finally you need to setup a post build action to make the test-report results visible.

The output of the *ocunit2junit* script is by default in a *test-reports* folder in the root directory of the build.

Add the following path to the *Test reports XMLs* field.

	**/test-reports/*.xml
	
##The final job
The bottom part of your Jenkins job should finally look like this:

##Result

As a result you should see a graph showing your test history of the project. It shows successfull (blue), failed (red) and skipped (yellow) tests.

Additionally you get a detailed test-report within each build.
