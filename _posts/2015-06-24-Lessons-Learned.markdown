It depends. The tools we used can be really powerful if configured and used correctly. But they can also make your workflow more complicated. <br>
If you are developing on your own or in a very small team, the whole pipeline might be a bit too much overhead.<br>
On the other hand, once the pipeline is configured, it can be relatively  easily adapted for the usage in new projects. <br>

In retrospect we also have to admit, that we had problems at some points, that could have been avoided if someone would already have had experience with jenkins and gerrit. Setting up a completely new CI pipeline with the knowledge we have now would be much easier and could probably be achieved within a couple of days.
