Now that we have created everything we need for code signing our application in the [previous post](http://ciforios.github.io/2015/05/08/Code-Signing/) we are ready to set up the Xcode project.

When you create a new project, Xcode will ask you for a product name, an organization name and an organization identifier. At this point it is important that these values match with the related ones of the App ID(s) you've created earlier.
